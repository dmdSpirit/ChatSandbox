------------------------------
Future:
- Finish building site that was left by builder
- Update win condition
- Units can attack buildings
- Repair
- Bots getting stuck in the building while idle walking
- Update players UI
- building site (units have to carry resources needed for building to the building site to finish building)
- !build 'where' 'what' 'direction'
- build zone (sc pylon or radius around any building)
- BAN LIST
- Figure a way to remove units collision with each other
- Map generation
- User database
    - user id consistency
- !kill userName (attack userName if unit is found in agro radius)
- Commands for bots (specify a sector to work in)
- Plant trees
- !move a2
- after v3-4 refactor and solve all //TODO:s
- Workers move slower with resources
- Unit regeneration
- Stop using NavMesh. (Check Pathfinder: Kingmaker game code for other navigation system)
- Different speed for idle walking, chasing and so on
- For all state distances (gathering distance) also add distance component from target (stone radius > tree radius => should gather from different distance)
