- Repair
- building site (units have to carry resources needed for building to the building site to finish building)
- build zone (sc pylon or radius around any building)
- Commands for bots (specify a sector to work in)
- !move a2
- Workers move slower with resources
- Unit regeneration

- For all state distances (gathering distance) also add distance component from target (stone radius > tree radius => should gather from different distance)

- Rework test map
- Test for 10-15 units in team
