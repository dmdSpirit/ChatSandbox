v3 (building) 18.01.2021

+ !move a2
+ !build 'where' 'what' 'direction'
- building site (units have to carry resources needed for building to the building site to finish building)
- Update commands
    - !build a2 (takes 1 parameter and commands unit to work on construction site in a2 if there is any)
- Commands for bots (specify a sector to work in)
    - !bot team index command
    - !bot team index build a2
- fix: Build site progress bar is rotated with the bulding
- build zone (sc pylon or radius around any building)
- Finish building site that was left by builder
- Units can attack buildings
- Repair
- Update win condition
- Rework ResultsUI
- Workers move slower with resources
- Unit regeneration
- Respawn timer UI
- Different speed for idle walking, chasing and so on
- For all state distances (gathering distance) also add distance component from target (stone radius > tree radius => should gather from different distance)
    - Fix getting stuck when trying to patrol tile with base building
- Rework test map
- Test for 10-15 units in team

--------------------------
- Gameplay footage 

------------------------------
Future:
- Bot units get commands from the team priority list (get resources/build).
- Chat command errors.
- Rage attacks and jobs (mage/archer)
- More verbose help
- Bots getting stuck in the building while idle walking
- BAN LIST
- Unit should be able override delivery if it has resources needed right now.
- Figure a way to remove units collision with each other
- Map generation
- User database
    - user id consistency
- !kill userName (attack userName if unit is found in agro radius)
- Plant trees
- after v3-4 refactor and solve all //TODO:s
- Stop using NavMesh. (Check Pathfinder: Kingmaker game code for other navigation system)
- Show current task icon or visualize path
- Rework unit/unitBehaviour classes and chat commands.
